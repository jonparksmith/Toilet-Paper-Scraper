# Toilet-Paper-Scraper
Because I'm sick of paying absorbent prices for toilet paper these days.  EDIT: I actually meant exorbitant. 

This tool scrapes Amazon (Canadian) website for a specific toilet paper roll and sends me (or anyone you want) an email when it drops below a certain price point.

If you want to re-use the code, make sure to replace the areas that require your email and passwords, and your personal user agent.  You can find this by just googling "my user agent".

Feel free to play around with different URLs (assuming the website allows web scraping).
