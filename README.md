# Toilet-Paper-Scraper
Because I'm sick of paying absorbent prices for toilet paper these days.  EDIT: I actually meant exorbitant. 

This tool scrapes Amazon (France) website for a specific toilet paper roll and sends me (or anyone you want) an email when it drops below a certain price point.

There are a couple steps you will need to accomplish in order to use this tool:

    1. Ensure you have requests module and BeautifulSoup installed
    2. Find your User Agent by searching for it in google
    3. Due to Google's 2FA, you will need to create an app password to use with this tool.  Instructions can be found here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833
    4. Fill out the "private" file with you email, app password, and user agent

Feel free to play around with different URLs (assuming the website allows web scraping).
